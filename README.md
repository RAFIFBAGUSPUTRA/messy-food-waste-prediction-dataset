🚀[Data Science Project: Predicting Food Waste in Industrial Kitchens]

I just completed a data science project focused on analyzing and predicting food waste generation in large-scale kitchen operations. This project was developed using a real-world dataset of 900+ records containing operational, environmental, and staffing data 📊🍽️

✨ Project Highlights:

📈 Analyzing patterns in food waste across different kitchen conditions
👨‍🍳 Studying the impact of staff experience and workload on waste generation
🌡️ Incorporating weather data (temperature, humidity) as contextual factors
🧠 Using historical waste data to inform predictive models
🔍 Cleaning and normalizing inconsistent categorical values (e.g. waste category labels)

💡 One interesting insight: kitchens with more experienced staff tend to produce significantly less food waste, especially during special events.

📎 Code and full report will be available soon on GitHub.

Big thanks to @Dibimbing.id for the guidance and collaborative learning experience! 🙌

🚀 Open to feedback, discussion, or collaboration in sustainability & data analytics!
